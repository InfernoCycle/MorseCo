# MorseCo/Con's Morse
MorseCo or Con's Morse is the name of my Program. Unlike alot of Morse Code Translator's found on the internet where all translated morse codes are converted to capitalized letters only, Con's Morse Translator can distinguish and convert morse code to either upper or lower case letters.
